This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Program description

Lots of coffee shops, especially those in major cities, are having trouble with their operating efficiency during busy hours. This is an app designed for the cashiers in coffee shops, for recording some feature data of the customers when taking orders, aiming to help coffee shop owners to identify and improve the weak links in their operations.

### Functionality

The stopwatch on top allows the cashiers to record the time each customer spends on deciding their order, followed by which is an input bar for entering the number of drinks in each order. During each order, the cashiers should input both of the above data and click the "submit" button to record them. The recorded data set will be displayed in the following data form. To clear the memories, simply click the "reset" button at the bottom.

### Benefits

This app is very intuitive and easy to use. It demands little extra work from the cashiers, and provides key data for the owners to analyse the operations of their coffee shops. The data recorded are useful for identifying certain trends and calculating correlations.

### App deployment

Link to the [Heroku CLI](https://cc-coffeetawk.herokuapp.com)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
